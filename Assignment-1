Need to Set-up the Build Environment for Java Maven Applications :::
	
		1. Create a Linux Script to Set-up the Build Environment for Java Maven Applications
		
		2. Create Linux User with ssh keys to perform Application Builds 
		
		3. Perform regular clean-up of the workspace dir 


Error faced: [sudo] password for sourceuser: sourceuser is not in the sudoers file.

Solution:
exit from sourceuser by giving command "Exit"
go to root user give access to sourceuser by giving command "usermod -aG sudo sourceuser"
then log back to source user and execute the shell script.

Answer:

1. Create a Linux Script to Set-up the Build Environment for Java Maven Applications.
vi shell-script


#!/bin/bash

echo 'Set-up the Build Environment for Java Maven Applications.'

sudo apt update -y

sudo apt install $1 -y
sudo apt install $2 -y

echo 'Application installed successfully'

:wq


chmod 755 shell-script.sh

./shell-script.sh jdk17 maven


2. Create Linux User with ssh keys to perform Application Builds .

useradd sourceuser -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/sourceuser

passwd sourceuser

su - sourceuser

ll-a

mkdir .ssh

ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521

cat id_ecdsa.pub > authorized_keys

chmod 600 authorized_keys 


3. Perform regular clean-up of the workspace dir 


#!/bin/bash

echo 'Perform regular clean-up of the workspace dir'

WORKSPACE=/home/sourceuser/shell-scripting

find $WORKSPACE -type f -mtime +7 -delete
find $WORKSPACE -type d -empty -delete



find	           ###Search for files/directories
$WORKSPACE	       ###Start searching from this directory
-type f	           ###Only regular files (not directories)
-mtime +7	       ###Modified more than 7 days ago
-delete	           ###Delete the matched files





-type d	      ###Only directories
-empty	      ###Directory has no files/subdirectories
-delete	      ###Remove the directory



CHATGPT Script::::


#!/bin/bash

# Exit if not run as root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Please run this script as root or using sudo"
  exit 1
fi

# Check arguments
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <java-package> <maven-package>"
  exit 1
fi

JAVA_PKG=$1
MAVEN_PKG=$2

echo "Updating system..."
apt update -y

echo "Installing Java and Maven..."
apt install -y $JAVA_PKG $MAVEN_PKG

echo "Verifying installations..."
java -version
mvn -version

echo "Build environment setup completed successfully."
